Pierre the Pear was a single pear without a hair. The things he'd wear, he would not share.

No, this hat was his, he was a dressing wiz, so he'd thought, maybe he should start a biz.

Pierre the Pear did not do math well. So he decided to get the help of his friend Blinkey the owl.

Blinkey was known through the land for his eyes, which people described as being nice.


pierre is confused.

He'd thought of paying Blinkey a visit but when he reached Blinkey's place, he found him asleep.

"That's a dumb owl, asleep at 9 in the morning.", thought Pierre the Pear without a hair.

Instead he said, I'll call ahead, to someone not in bed, the Turtle named Red. Indeed, indeed, I shall call Red.

Pierre do not like eating pear and he likes eating his hair.

pierre is strange and wired.

How to get to Red though, to end this show, he must find and go.
